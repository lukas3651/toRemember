<h3>All Brains are beautiful - The biology of Neurodiversity<h3>
<h3>Marcello<h3>

- the Neurodiversity Umbrella
    - Dyskalkulie
  - epilepsy
  - ADHD
  - Autism
  - ASPD
  - BPD
  - Dyspraxia
  - PTSD
  - Dyscalculia
  - HSP
  - Dyspgraphia
- Judy Singer worked to promote equality of  "Neurominorities"
- neurodiverse is not neurodivergent
- Neurodigergergence is the two ends of the normal distribution 
- scientific research is biased by diagnosis and social stigma
- publication bias: Focus on what is publishable, interesting/ significant 
- constructed model systems due to stigma
- survivorship Bias " We tested patients in clinic XYZ"
- clinic criteria vs subclinical features
- ADHD and Autism 
 - can coexist with paradoxical Traits (hyper focus)
 - similar risk Factor
 - genes involved in synaptic connectivity 
 - improved in ICD11 in 2022 (transition period of 5 years ) 
 - autism 1/36
  - 28% of them have ADHD
  - intense world theory
 - ADHD /10-20
  - 136 genes linked 
  - 20-50% have Audhd
  - 27 genes linked 
  - dopamine, norepinephrine, serotin pathways are effected
  - highly diverse spectrum
  - 1775 first described ADHD
  - Ritalin is the first Stimulant medication 
 - our brain is the base of making sense what we perceive inside and outside our body
   - sensory / stimulus processing involves 
   - outside world 
   - body ( proprioception ) 
   - thoughts, feelings, memories
- input sensitivity 
- context can influence the processing of signals - theory of Monotropism for Autism
 - different strategies of brains to cope with abundance of input
 - polytrophic means a good amount of filtering 
 - monotropic most of the attention goes to one thing only 
 - control over excitation and regulation US dysregualted in autism and ADHD
 - dopamine reguales the balance of networks
 - ADHD and autism have more intrusive thoughts 
 - autistic brains process and create more information ar rest than NTs
 - Default mode Network 
 - Psylocybin decreases DMN activity
 - local sleep could also explain ADHD traits
 - local sleep in a mower circuit as a new concept based on recent research
 - most Networks are established during development
 - synesthesia-like connectivity trough novel cross talk
 - simple touch can be cross talked to make it painful 
 - Natural variability in connectivity 
  - even genetically identical brains display differences in connectivity ( stochastic variability)
  - external factory can have strong effects
  - diversity is diverse
  - local roles and differences of neurotransmitters unclear
